# Electrosynthesis-Optimization
Source code and raw data for the ACS Electrochemistry paper

Attention: The code was built based on a cost-aware parallelized Bayesian optimization method (Paper: CAPBO: A cost‚Äêaware parallelized Bayesian optimization method for chemical reaction optimization, DOI: 10.1002/aic.18316). Please read the corresponding AIChE paper first and add necessary modifications to the Bayesian-optimization package according to the Github link below before running the code; otherwise, it cannot be run normally.
